# Computing the means of each variable in matrices 
colMeans(survival_matrix)
# mean value for each column in survival matrix 

colMeans(non_survival_matrix)
# mean value for each column in non survival matrix  

# Covariance matrix for survival matrix
cov(survival_matrix)
# total length and alar extent very good
# l_humerous and total length very less 

# Covariance matrix for non survival matrix
cov(non_survival_matrix)

# Inference :Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together.
# When we observe the covariance matrices for both survival and non survival data
# we can see that the alar extent vs total length for survival matrix has a value of 9.10 
# and in the non survival matrix the value is 17.19 which means that they are highly dependent on each other 
# also higher the corvariance between these variables, lower are the chances of survival 


# Correlation matrix for survival matrix
cor(survival_matrix)
 # Inferences : We know that correlation indicates how strongly two variables are related 
# as we can see from the correlation matrix of survival_matrix, the correlation values 
# of L_keel_sternum and L_humerous is 0.4165447 which positive and less strongly related
 # for the non survival matrix, the value of L_keel_sternum and L_humerous is 0.6677936
# which is again positive and less strongly related 
# Now since the range of the values in the correlation values is always between -1 to +1,
# we see that there is a decent difference between the two values  


# Correlation matrix for non survival matrix
cor(non_survival_matrix)
